# Gamepad to Mouse

Small utility that implements a virtual mouse that you can control using a gamepad.
Currently on really early stages, it still lacks the ability to recognize gamepads when plugged and map their buttons. It only works when a gamepad is already plugged in at the start and it's located on the /dev/input/js0.

## Current features

-   Move pointer using left joystick
-   Left click with X button
-   Right click with O button.
-   Middle click with RB (Allows for scroll when holding it and moving the joystick)

## TODO

-   [ ] Ability to map buttons and load configurations
-   [ ] Ability to map buttons to mouse actions
