# Gamepad to Mouse

Small utility that implements a virtual mouse that you can control using a gamepad.
Uses SDL to handle the Gamepads currently

## Current features

-   Move pointer using left joystick
-   Left click with X button
-   Right click with O button.
-   Middle click with RB (Allows for scroll when holding it and moving the joystick)

## TODO

-   [ ] Add a small interface, maybe TUI to map mouse/keyboard events to buttons.
